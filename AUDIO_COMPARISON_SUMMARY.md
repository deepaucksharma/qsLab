## Quality Rankings

1. **Tacotron2-DDC** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Best overall quality
   - Most natural sounding
   - Professional narration quality

2. **Edge TTS** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - Good neural voice quality
   - Multiple voice options
   - Excellent file compression

3. **Google TTS** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Acceptable quality
   - Clear but somewhat robotic
   - Good for basic needs

4. **pyttsx3** ⭐⭐
   - Basic system TTS
   - Very robotic
   - Only for offline requirements

## Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Primary**: Continue using **Tacotron2-DDC** for main content
   - Provides the best quality
   - Worth the larger file sizes for educational content
   
2. **Alternative**: Consider **Edge TTS** for:
   - Content where file size matters
   - When voice variety is needed
   - Multi-language support

### For Different Use Cases:
- **High Quality Required**: Tacotron2-DDC
- **File Size Critical**: Edge TTS (86% smaller)
- **Offline Only**: pyttsx3 or local Tacotron2
- **Quick Prototyping**: Google TTS

   ```

2. Listen to each engine's output for the same text
3. Compare:
   - Voice clarity
   - Natural prosody
   - Pronunciation accuracy
   - Overall listening experience

## Conclusion

The current Tacotron2-DDC implementation provides the highest quality audio for the Neural Learn platform. While it produces larger files, the superior voice quality justifies the storage requirements for an educational platform where clear, professional narration is critical.

Edge TTS emerges as a strong alternative when file size is a concern or when voice variety is needed, offering good quality at 86% smaller file sizes.
