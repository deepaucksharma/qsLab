# Recommendations for TechFlix

Based on the current state of the repository these actions are suggested to strengthen the project.

1. **Complete Missing Episodes**
   - Several episodes mentioned in `seriesData.js` are only partially implemented.
   - Finalising these episodes will provide a more complete learning path and remove dead links.

2. **Introduce a Lightweight Backend**
   - Persist user progress, quiz results and preferences across devices.
   - Provide optional authentication to save watch history.
   - A small Node.js/Express or serverless backend could suffice.

3. **Expand Testing Coverage**
   - Add more tests for scene components and interactive logic.
   - Consider end‑to‑end tests with Playwright or Cypress for critical flows.

4. **Review Documentation Archive**
   - The `docs/archives` folder is large and may contain outdated content.
   - Curate or summarise old documents so newcomers can find essential information quickly.

5. **Accessibility and Internationalisation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly.
   - Provide transcripts for voice overs and consider adding basic i18n support for a broader audience.

6. **Performance Optimisation**
   - Investigate lazy loading of multimedia assets per episode to reduce initial bundle size.
   - Use bundle analysis tools (already configured) regularly to avoid regressions.

Implementing these improvements would help scale TechFlix from a well designed demo into a polished platform for technical learning.
