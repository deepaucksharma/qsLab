## üí° Conclusion

The TechFlix platform shows promise but is **not ready for production** due to critical UX failures, especially on mobile devices. The desktop experience demonstrates the potential, but fundamental issues must be addressed before launch.

**Recommendation**: Focus on P0 fixes immediately, especially mobile navigation and core player functionality.
