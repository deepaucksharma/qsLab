3. Let episode start playing
4. Observe Evolution Timeline scene

**Timing Checkpoints**:

#### Audio Start (0-2s)
- [ ] Background music starts immediately
- [ ] No audio delay or stutter
- [ ] Volume levels appropriate
- [ ] Voice-over begins on time

#### Animation Sync (2-10s)
- [ ] Timeline animation matches narration pace
- [ ] Year markers appear when mentioned
- [ ] Particle effects don't lag
- [ ] Text reveals sync with speech

#### Subtitle Timing
- [ ] Subtitles appear with voice
- [ ] Text matches spoken words
- [ ] No early/late appearance
- [ ] Proper duration on screen

**Expected Results**:
- Audio latency < 100ms
- Animation frame rate > 30fps
- Perfect subtitle synchronization
- No audio interruptions

**Actual Results**:
```
[ Record observations here ]
- Audio start time: ___ms
- First animation: ___ms
- Subtitle delay: ___ms
- Frame rate: ___fps
```

### Test 2: Scene Transitions

**Steps**:
1. Continue from Test 1
2. Wait for scene transition
3. Monitor audio continuity
4. Check animation smoothness

**Checkpoints**:

#### During Transition
- [ ] Audio continues without cut
- [ ] No clicking/popping sounds
- [ ] Background music fades properly
- [ ] Voice-over doesn't restart

#### After Transition
- [ ] New scene audio starts correctly
- [ ] Previous audio cleaned up
- [ ] No audio overlap
- [ ] Animations initialize smoothly

**Expected Results**:
- Zero audio interruptions
- Smooth crossfade (if any)
- Clean scene swap
- Memory properly released

**Actual Results**:
```
[ Record observations here ]
- Transition duration: ___ms
- Audio gap (if any): ___ms
- Visual glitch: Yes/No
- Console errors: ___
```

### Test 3: Interactive Moments

**Steps**:
1. Play until interactive moment
2. Check if audio pauses correctly
3. Complete interaction
4. Verify audio resumes

**Checkpoints**:

#### Pause Behavior
- [ ] Audio pauses at right moment
- [ ] Animation freezes appropriately
- [ ] No audio continues in background
- [ ] UI responds immediately

#### Resume Behavior
- [ ] Audio resumes from correct position
- [ ] No audio skip or repeat
- [ ] Animation continues smoothly
- [ ] Timing remains synchronized

**Expected Results**:
- Instant pause response
- Perfect resume timing
- No desynchronization
- Smooth interaction flow

### Test 4: Performance Under Load

**Steps**:
1. Open Performance monitor
2. Play episode for 5 minutes
3. Monitor metrics
4. Check for degradation

**Metrics to Track**:

#### CPU Usage
- [ ] Baseline: ___%
- [ ] During animations: ___%
- [ ] With audio: ___%
- [ ] Peak usage: ___%

#### Memory Usage
- [ ] Start: ___MB
- [ ] After 1 min: ___MB
- [ ] After 5 min: ___MB
- [ ] Growth rate: ___MB/min

#### Frame Rate
- [ ] Average FPS: ___
- [ ] Minimum FPS: ___
- [ ] Drops below 30fps: ___times
- [ ] Jank episodes: ___

**Expected Results**:
- CPU < 50% average
- Memory growth < 10MB/min
- FPS > 30 consistently
- No major jank

## üîç Console Monitoring

### Expected Logs
```javascript
// Audio loading
"Loading episode audio s2e1"
"Episode audio loaded successfully"

// Scene transitions
"Scene transition: from X to Y"
