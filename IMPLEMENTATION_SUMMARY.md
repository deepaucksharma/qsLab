- Basic certificate support

## 🔧 Integration Fixes Applied

1. **Global Exports Fixed**
   - `window.visualAssetManager` - Now accessible globally
   - `window.api` - API service exposed for all components
   - `window.adaptiveLearning` - Available when loaded

2. **Missing Endpoints Added**
   - `/api/init-course-data` - Initialize sample courses
   - `/audio/<filename>` - Serve audio files
   - `/static/placeholders/<filename>` - Dynamic placeholder generation

3. **Database Initialization**
   - Replaced deprecated `@app.before_first_request`
   - Proper initialization in main block
   - Interactive cue templates auto-created

4. **Directory Structure**
   - Created `/static/placeholders/` directory
   - All required directories auto-created

5. **Dependencies Updated**
   - Added `numpy` for adaptive learning
   - Added `flask-sqlalchemy` for ORM
